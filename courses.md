### Advanced Topics in Embodied Cognitive Science: Mind, Life, and Complexity (summer semester 2022, online) ###
Seminar exploring how ideas about complexity and nonlinear dynamics inform views about the nature of cognition (key terms: self-organization, autocatakinetics and autopoiesis) and about the relation between cognition and life (key term: the life-mind continuity thesis) as well as other biological phenomena occurring at different spatiotemporal scales, including (a) the timescales of behavior (i.e., seconds, minutes and hours), development (i.e., an agent’s lifespan) and evolution (i.e., the entire history of a species), and (b) the spatial scales going from the single cell, through entire organisms and organism-environment systems, up to the whole planet (Gaia hypothesis).
