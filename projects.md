The following are some of the diverse projects currently being developed by EMBODY Research Group members:

# Dynamics of Insight in Graph Comprehension

Currently popular accounts explain insight as involving some kind of internal representational restructuring. In contrast with this dominant approach, we are currently conducting an eye-tracking experiment and using nonlinear analysis methods to show how, as an embodied phenomenon, the `Aha moment' manifests itself in different behavioral patterns, including patterns of visual exploration, and can usefully be cast non-representationally in terms of a phase transition in the dynamically changing cognitive system.

# Thoughts as tools + mental health

(People: Joao Lucas Mendes de Lemos Lins, Gui Sanches de Oliveira)

In this project we are exploring a practical application, in the context of cognitive behavioral therapy, of Sanches de Oliveira, Raja and Chemero's (2021) radical embodied, non-representational account of occurrent thoughts (e.g., counterfactual imagination, remembering past events, and making plans for the future) as _tools_ that we build by resonating to nonlocal information at different timescales. Here, a cellphone app is being developed that prompts patients to record their thoughts (specially their self-defeating beliefs, negative attitudes, fears etc.) and, based on these patient reports, the app will provide therapists with ways to identify overarching themes in the patient's thinking in order to support therapy outcomes.

# The nonlinear dynamics of presence in virtual environments

Traditional methods for assessing the sense of "presence" in virtual reality environments, such as questionnaires, presuppose a separation between a userâ€™s subjective experience and their overt behavior. Challenging this common assumption, in this project we apply nonlinear analysis methods to EEG time-series from an experiment in which the participants' experience in virtual reality was artificially disrupted: our goal is to develop an objective, action-based measure of presence in virtual reality based on the dynamical signature of the brain-body-environment system.

# Brain-Body Dynamics and Affordances for grasping and pointing

(People: Bilal Arafaat, Gui Sanches de Oliveira, Klaus Gramann)

Studying simple behaviors like pointing and grasping can be a powerful means to understanding the complexity of perception-action coupling dynamics at the neural and behavioral scales. In this project we manipulate measures related to the affordance for reaching, while varying the order of presentation and instructions, in order to determine the extent to which these lower and higher order constraints affect perception-action-related neural activity and behavioral performance.

# Embodied Exploration & Affordances in Neuroarchitecture

(People: Sheng Wang, Gui Sanches de Oliveira, Klaus Gramann)

Research in neuroarchitecture investigates the neural basis of human perception of, and action within, the surrounding architectural environment, often with the goal of understanding the cognitive processes at play during this interaction and of providing a foundation for evidence-based architectural design. In this project we examine the shortcomings of contemporary neuroarchitectural research, and we propose that combining theoretical and conceptual resources from ecological psychology with state-of-the-art neuroscience methods (Mobile Brain/Body Imaging) is a promising way to push the field of neuroarchitecture forward.
