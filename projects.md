The following are some of the diverse projects currently being developed by EMBODY Research Group members:

Currently popular accounts explain insight as involving some kind of internal representational restructuring. In contrast with this dominant approach, we are conducting an eye-tracking experiment and using nonlinear analysis methods to show how, as an embodied phenomenon, the "Aha moment" manifests itself in different behavioral patterns, including patterns of visual exploration, and can usefully be cast non-representationally in terms of a phase transition in the dynamically changing cognitive system.

# Brain-Body Dynamics and Affordances for grasping and pointing

Studying simple behaviors like pointing and grasping can be a powerful means to understanding the complexity of perception-action coupling dynamics at the neural and behavioral scales. In this project we manipulate measures related to the affordance for reaching, while varying the order of presentation and instructions, in order to determine how these lower and higher order constraints affect perception-action-related neural activity and behavioral performance.

# Embodied Exploration & Affordances in Neuroarchitecture

(People: Sheng Wang, Gui Sanches de Oliveira, Klaus Gramann)

Research in neuroarchitecture investigates the neural basis of human perception of, and action within, the surrounding architectural environment, often with the goal of understanding the cognitive processes at play during this interaction and of providing a foundation for evidence-based architectural design. In this project we examine the shortcomings of contemporary neuroarchitectural research, and we propose that combining theoretical and conceptual resources from ecological psychology with state-of-the-art neuroscience methods (Mobile Brain/Body Imaging) is a promising way to push the field of neuroarchitecture forward.
