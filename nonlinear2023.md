**Where:** TU Berlin – Main building (Straße des 17. Juni 135), room H3025
 
**When:** Thursday, June 8, 2023  - from 11:45am to 4pm

**Target audience:** Students of all levels (bachelor's, master's, PhD). No prior knowledge of dynamical systems theory (DST) will be assumed, but basic familiarity with, and interest in, embodied cognitive science will be helpful.

**Instructors:** Vicente Raja (University of Murcia), Gui Sanches de Oliveira (TU Berlin), and Miriam Kyselo (NTNU Trondheim)

**Goal:** This workshop aims to provide a gentle introduction to dynamical systems theory for psychology and philosophy students, with a specific focus on radical embodied (e.g., enactive, ecological) approaches to mind/life. Besides introducing basic concepts from DST and giving an overview of popular modeling and data analysis methods, we will also discuss examples of philosophically-oriented applications of these methods.
